This is a simple [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) project bootstrapped with
[`dext`](https://dext.vercel.app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development bot:

```bash
dext dev
```

You can edit your bot by modifying `src/commands/static.ts`. The bot
auto-updates as you edit the files.

You can check out
[the Dext GitHub repository](https://github.com/inbestigator/dext) - your
feedback and contributions are welcome!
